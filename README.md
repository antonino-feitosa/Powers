## History

You are an entity in a world of war and research, training to become a warrior. As part of your training, you must choose a race, a class, and powers. You can test different combinations and then you must join the quest researching new races, classes, powers, and weapons for your world.

## The Game

Initially, the user can choose a race, class, weapons, and powers among the initials. Then, he can choose a world to explore in which he must survive and return with the research data. This enables other races, classes, weapons, or powers which can be used in new explorations. The worlds are procedurally generated with only one exit and different puzzles, traps, and enemies. The powers have different skills progress after the user overcomes the corresponding challenges. The exploration provides adequate challenges based on user choices. The weapons, as the powers, have different skills the correspondent challenges. Besides the powers and skills challenges, the world presents different enemies and bosses. The bosses can be based on race and class generating data for new explorations. Deaths in the exploration generate a boss for the type of death. These bosses reward an additional treasure, but they are based on the state of the player before his death. The objective is to explore the dominating creator world with success. That is the most dangerous and difficult world rewarding power of freedom.
