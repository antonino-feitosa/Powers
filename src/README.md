# Powers Prototype

The prototype is textual[^17] (Typescript) based on the software architecture described in [^18].
It uses node with extend ANSI to render the game.

# TODO

- [x] Migrate to js to use prototype based inheritance.
- [x] Refactor removing references to Point. The world is a one dimensional array using the index as keys.
- [x] Refactor render message (move to Main accessing Context).
- [x] Fix Dijkstra Map.
